This day of the church calendar, Maundy Thursday, gets its name from John 13:34, which, in the Latin Vulgate, begins with "mandatum novum" â€” a new commandment. After washing the feet of the disciples earlier in chapter 13, Jesus told them,

"I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."

Neither feelings nor emotions can be commanded, for those are not within our control. We can only be commanded to act. Love, then, is a way of acting, living as Jesus lived; in his words, "For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you." (John 13:15)

So, by thinking of love as a feeling, I avoid having to keep the new commandment. I have taken something that I simply do not want to do, and turned it into something that is impossible for me to do. Then, I can go on loving only those whom I like and continue to rest comfortably in my self-righteousness.

May God forgive me.
