I was excited to see this excerpt from Neil Gaiman's new book recently in [USA Today][usatoday], explaining why he chose "Trigger Warning" as the title. It didn't strike me that the title could be controversial until I saw this [tweet](https://twitter.com/skinnygrlsfloat/status/561365292693999617 ) asking why he chose such a "thoughtless and insensitive title."
  It's no surprise that such accusations prompt a rather thoughtful and sensitive response from Gaiman, one of my favorite authors.

## Trigger Warnings ##

A trigger warning is an  statement that a film or work of literature portrays  scenes that some may find disturbing, especially for those who have experienced similar events themselves. Like Gaiman, I have conflicted feelings about trigger warnings.

On one hand, we ought to be sensitive to the emotional needs of others. I was at a conference with an Army colleague who had lost friends in the Korangal Valley when the speaker began showing clips from the documentary *Restrepo*. From her reaction, I don't think she was prepared to relive those experiences, especially in public.

On the other hand, it seems that much of the trigger warnings used in higher education, or at least Christian higher education, today are there not to protect those who have had disturbing experiences in the past, but to protect innocent minds from having particular kinds of experiences at all, like hearing vulgar speech or seeing a nude body. 

## Safe Christian Education? ##
