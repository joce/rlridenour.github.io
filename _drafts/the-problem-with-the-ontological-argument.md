I have been intrigued by the Ontological Argument for the existence of God since I was an undergraduate. I have gone from believing it be sound and persuasive, to believing it to be fallacious and completely unpersuasive, to believing it to be sound, but still completely unpersuasive.

Here is a simple version of the Ontological Argument loosely based on Plantinga's version in *The Nature of Necessity*:

1. God is a maximally perfect being.
2. Maximal perfection entails necessary existence.
3. It is possible that God exists.
4. Therefore, God exists.

The argument is valid in **S-5**. Given the first two premises, either God exists in no possible world or God exists in all possible worlds. Premise three states that there is a possible world in which God exists, so, God must exist in all possible worlds, including the actual world.[^3] 

It is common to think that this argument should be understood as a demonstration for the rationality of religious belief. The argument may not be a conclusive proof for the existence of God, but it is deductively valid, and so, if the premises are rational to believe, the conclusion must also be rational to believe. The first two premises are plausible, and the third is a relatively weak claim of logical possibility.

And so, theism is shown to be rational. But, before the believer begins to gloat, it should be noted that the unbeliever can adopt the same strategy:

1. God is a maximally perfect being.
2. Maximal perfection entails necessary existence.
3. It is possible that God does not exist.
4. Therefore, God does not exist.

If the atheist should concede that it's rational to believe the possibility premise in the first argument, then the theist should concede that it's rational to believe the possibility premise in the second argument. So, atheism is also shown to be rational. The success of each argument depends on the status of the modal premise. We seem to be trapped in a dilemma:

1. We cannot grant both that it is possible that God exists and possible that God does not exist, for we must then grant both that God does and does not exist. 
2. Yet both claims seem plausible, given that they are simply weak claims about possibilities.

## Modalities ##

"Modality" is used in nearly every field, philosophy included. It usually refers to a mode, method, or way in which something is done. In philosophy, modalities express something about what could be, or must be, the case. Here are some examples, with the type of modality in parentheses:

1. It must be the case that either God exists or not. (Logical)
2. A triangles must have three sides. (Analytic)
3. I could not have had different parents. (Metaphysical)
4. All other things being equal, one must not break a promise. (Deontic)
5. Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. (Physical)
6. Goldbach's Conjecture might be true, but then again, it might not. (Epistemic)

The first two are straightforward. The third expresses what many have thought to be a metaphysical law about the essentiality of origin. The fourth expresses a moral law, and the fifth expresses a physical law.

The sixth is interesting, Since Golbach's Conjecture[^2] is claim in mathematics, if it is true, it is necessarily true, and if false, necessarily false. So, this cannot be an expression of logical or metaphysical necessity. Instead, this is an example of what is called an epistemic modality â€” *for all I know*, Golbach's Conjecture might be false. As one would expect epistemic modalities tend to be used in ordinary conversation much more than metaphysical modalities.

## Evaluation of the Argument ##

The Ontological Argument rests on the claim that it is possible that God exists. Is this intended to be a claim about what is metaphysically possible, or about what is epistemically possible? If it is a metaphysical possibility, then the argument is valid, but it begs the question. Since the theistic argument and the atheistic argument differ only by that premise, the only reason to grant the premise is that one already believes the conclusion to be true. 

The strategy, though, is not to demand that an opponent grant that the modal premise is true, but only that it is rational to believe it. How though, does one demonstrate this? I assume that the conversation would go something like this:

*"Surely, you can't be certain that God does not exist, so it must be at least possible that God does exist."*

This, though, makes the modal premise a claim that it is epistemically possible that God exists, but epistemic possibility is not enough to make the argument valid. To say that it is epistemically possible that God exists is just to say that the existence of God is consistent with everything I know to be true. That, though, is not enough to entail that God exists.


[^2]: Golbach's Conjecture: every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

[^3]: Let $G$ be the proposition 'God exists' and $\alpha$ be the actual world. If $\Diamond \Box G$ is true in $\alpha$, then $\Box G$ must be true in some world, $w$ accessible to $\alpha$. $G$ is then true in $\alpha$ only if $\alpha$ is accessible to $w$. This requires that the accessbility relation be symmetric, which means that the argument is valid only in *S-5* or *B*.
