Here is a simple version of the Ontological Argument loosely based on Plantinga's version in *The Nature of Necessity*:

1. God is a maximally perfect being.
2. Maximal perfection entails necessary existence.
3. It is possible that God exists.
4. Therefore, God exists.

It is common to think that this argument should be understood as a demonstration for the rationality of religions belief. The argument is valid, and if the premises are rational to believe, the conclusion must also be rational to believe.


# Argument for Atheism

1. God is a maximally perfect being.
2. Maximal perfection entails necessary existence.
3. It is possible that God does not exist.
4. Therefore, God does not exist.


If the atheist should concede the possibility premise in the first argument, then the theist should concede the possibility premise in the second premise. 

# Evaluation of the Arguments

The success of each argument depends on the status of the modal premise. We seem to be trapped in a dilemma:

1. We cannot grant both that it is possible that God exists and possible that God does not exist, for we must then grant both that God does and does not exist. 
2. Yet both claims are plausible, given that they are simply weak claims about possibilities.

# Epistemic Possibility

Most actual claims about possibilities are claims about epistemic possibility. 

If the modal premise expresses an epistemic possibility, then the argument is invalid. 

If the argument expresses an alethic possibility, then the argument begs the question. The only reason the theist believes her premise is that she believes that God exists. Likewise for the atheist.
