There is no doubt that John Duns Scotus was brilliant. After arguing that it is possible that a being exist that is not dependent on any other, he then inferred that such a being must exist. If there were no such being, then nothing could be done to cause such a being to exist, for then it would be both dependent and not dependent on another. So, if there is no being that is not dependent on any other being, it would be impossible for there to be one. Since it is possible for there to be one, by Modus Tollens, such a being exists.
