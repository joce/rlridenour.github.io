I am an associate professor of philosophy at [Oklahoma Baptist University](www.okbu.edu). As one of only three philosophers at the university, I teach a number of different courses. Courses that I teach regularly are Introduction to Philosophy, Critical Thinking, History of Philosophy (Ancient, Medieval, and Early Modern), Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Language, Existentialism, and Aesthetics.

My research has been on the nature and justification of religious belief, the relation of religious belief to ethics, and the role of mystery in religious belief. My recent work is on the problem of religious tolerance, the effect social media on community, and the the role of religion in counterinsurgencies.

I am also a chaplain in the United States Army Reserve. My service includes tours at Ft. Hood, Texas, Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.

I live in Norman, Oklahoma, with my wife, Sheri. We have one daughter, Rachael, who is pursuing a master's degree in cello-performance major at Oklahoma City University and lives with her husband, Josh.
