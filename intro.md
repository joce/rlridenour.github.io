## Short Answer ##

**Question:** Describe the difference between the logical, the evidential, and the existential problems of evil. That is, what do each attempt to prove?
          
**Answer:** The logical problem of evil attempts to show that the existence of God is logically incompatible with the existence of evil or suffering. The evidential problem attempts to show that the existence of God is unlikely given the existenence of this much suffering. The existential problem attempts to show that a person's life can have no meaning given the suffering they have experienced in the world.

## Essay ##

1. Explain the argument.
2. Explain the strongest objection to the argument.
3. Present the best response to the objection.
