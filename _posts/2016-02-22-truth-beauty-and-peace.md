Father,

There are days  
when it seems  
like I'm creating  
a minefield with  
carefully placed  
hazards of  
discord,  
ugliness,  
and lies.

Help me instead  
to plant seeds of  
truth,  
beauty,  
and peace;  
building a place  
where others can  
run without care â€” 

Barefoot,  
with joy,  
in the fields   
of the Lord.
