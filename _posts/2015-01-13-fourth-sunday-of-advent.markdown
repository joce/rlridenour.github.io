Sometimes it seems  
like the world  
is filled  
with a darkness  
that threatens  
to shatter our lives  
and destroy all hope,

but as our eyes  
are opened in worship  
we see that this darkness  
is but a shadow that flees  
as the light of Christ  
comes into the world.

May your light shine upon us,  
may it shine in us,  
may it shine through us.

*Amen*
