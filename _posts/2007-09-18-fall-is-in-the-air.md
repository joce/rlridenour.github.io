<p>Everyone is loving the weather. We can feel a little nip in the air, and it feels like we're moving into fall. The high is only supposed to be 104 today with a low of 79 tonight. That might not seem so cool, but remember it was 125 when we got here... and, as they say, it's a dry heat.</p>
<p>Â The cooler temperatures also seem to have made a difference in the moods of people I see. Thank God for cool breezes.</p>
<p>Also, thanks for the jokes. If this were a contest, Patty would be in the lead with the Forrest Gump joke. Maybe the kids at Westwood can give me some of their favorites!</p>
<p>Blessings</p>
