<p>My unit is honored to have been adopted by the Westwod Elementary School in Oklahoma City. You can view their web page at <a href="http://www.okcps.org/es/westwood/">http://www.okcps.org/es/westwood/</a>. It means a lot to us to know that people are thinking of us, and want to help. Thanks, Dr. Jan, and all of the faculty, staff and students at Westwood. When I get back from Iraq, I'm going to visit you andÂ give my thanks in person!</p>
