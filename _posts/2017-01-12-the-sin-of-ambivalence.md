Holy God,

The greatest tragedy  
is not to hate God,  
for the one who hates  
has God ever present  
before his mind.

It is ambivalence,  
thoughtless and uncaring,  
a life that is at once  
both full and empty,  
full of trivialities,  
yet empty of meaning

Heal my lukewarm heart, Lord,  
and restore me to my first love.

*Amen*
