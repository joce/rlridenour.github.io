Lord of all,

What are these hands  
that they should seize   
what is offered as a free gift?

What are these hands  
that they should grasp  
what should be shared?

What are these hands  
that they should clench in anger  
at the thought that you   
would ever bless anyone else?

What are these hands?

Just the hands of one  
who would once again   
crucify the Christ.

A sinner,  
lost but for  
the grace of God.

*Amen*
