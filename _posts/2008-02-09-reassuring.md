<p>I'm back after enduring another three days of travel. After we arrived at Ali al Salim Air Base in Kuwait, a captain that I was walking with said, "It seems strangely reassuring to be back." I replied, "You're right, and that's more than a little bit sad." We have all become used to being here, and now the familiarity is reasurring in its own way. We find the familiar to be comfortable, while the unfamiliar is uncomfortable. It prompts me to wonder what else we accept only because it is familiar and comfortable. Might this help to explain our still mostly segregated churches and predominantly male leadership?</p>
