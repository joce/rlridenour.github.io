<p>Our winter season has passed, I believe. I know that those of you in the central US won't feel that low temperatures in the high 30's really deserve to be called "winter." Remember, though, that you don't have to walk 50 yards from your house to the bathroom in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The high on Monday is supposed to be 93 degrees. So, winter has passed, summer is here, and I don't recall spring. Fortunately, we'll be gone before the 120's come.</p>
