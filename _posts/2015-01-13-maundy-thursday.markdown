The one who had already  
shed all the privileges of God,  
also shed his outer robe.  
Wrapping himself in a simple towel,  
he lovingly washed the disciples' feet  
with his calloused hands.  
  
Teach us, Lord, to shed  
our own trappings of power and prestige,  
as we reach out to those rejected by the world;  
and may we always have the grace to accept   
the things that you have had the grace to offer.  
  
Amen
