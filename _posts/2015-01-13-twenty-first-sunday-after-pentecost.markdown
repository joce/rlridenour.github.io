Lord,

Stay with me  
for a moment  
while I divide  
up my life.

I'll give you Sunday,  
but I'm keeping  
Monday through Saturday.

I'll give you ten percent,  
so long as you don't  
ask what I do with  
the other ninety.

I'll do whatever you ask,  
just don't make any  
unreasonable demands.

Then, in the stillness,  
I hear a quiet voice  
whisper the question  
I'm afraid to answer:

>Why do you call me "Lord?"

Lord, have mercy.

*Amen*
