<p>We leave today for a four-day pass! Tomorrow will be the first day off that we have had since May 6. Everyone is tired, but in great spirits and excited to see our families. Sheri and Rachael are flying to Philadelphia to meet me there, and we will spend four great days together. Very soon after that, I'll be flying east. I think everyone in the unit is ready to move on to new and exciting things.</p>
<p>I pray that spirits are rejuvenated and that relationships are strengthened over the next few days.</p>
