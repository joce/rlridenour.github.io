<p>I went to Taji last night to visit three soldiers. It was the wildest helicopter ride that I've ever had. We went up, then down, then rolled onto the left side, then the right side, then shot some flares out, then repeated the cycle for an hour. Just when I thought I was going to lose my lunch, we landed. The guys there were grateful for the visit, so I guess it was worth it. Next time, I won't eat the chili dog for lunch.</p>
