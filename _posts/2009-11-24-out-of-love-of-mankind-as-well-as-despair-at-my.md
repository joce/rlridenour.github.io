<blockquote>Out of love of mankind, as well as despair at my embarrassing situation, seeing I had not accomplished anything and had been unable to make anything easier than it had already been made, from a genuine interest in those who make everything easy, I conceived it my task to make difficulties everywhere.</p></blockquote>
