*A prayer for reconciliation.*

God of love,

We open our arms  
to hug and to hold,  
welcome and invite.

With outstretched hands,  
we lower our defenses  
and accept the vulnerability  
that comes with love.

Did the soldiers know  
what they were doing  
as they stretched the arms  
of Jesus onto the cross?

Humiliated and scorned,  
the Eternal King  
chose vulnerability, love,  
and reconciliation  
instead of rejection.

Give us the courage  
to do the same.

*Amen*
