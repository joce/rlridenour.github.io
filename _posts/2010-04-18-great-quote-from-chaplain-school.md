<p>From a briefing given by an Army Chaplain about the new Inter-service Chaplain Center that is shared by the Army, Navy, and Air Force:</p>
<p>"We didn't foresee the challenges that we would have with a building shared by the three services. Each service has its own customs, traditions, and even language. For example, we had to order three different signs for the restrooms - one that said 'Latrine' for the Army, 'Head' for the Navy, and 'Powder Room' for the Air Force."</p>
