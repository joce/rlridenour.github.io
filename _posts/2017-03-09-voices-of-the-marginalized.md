I began teaching the thought of the 12th century philosopher Abelard in medieval philosophy today, and had to tell the story of his relationship with Heloise. Her letters reveal a deep intelligence, a quick wit, and brilliant insight. 

*How many other brilliant voices have been marginalized over the years?* 

*What wisdom have we missed by silencing them?*
