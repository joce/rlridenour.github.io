Loving God,

We give thanks this day,  
for those who care  
for children,  
for aging parents,  
and for neighbors,  
for anyone who needs  
a warm smile,  
a cheerful greeting,  
or a kind word.


And we are blessed  
by those who  
love every child  
as one of their own,  
for reflected  
in their eyes,  
we see the face  
of Jesus.

*Amen*
