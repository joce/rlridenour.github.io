<p>I don't have much time to post anything today. I'm leaving on a trip to visit some soldiers on another base. I don't think Sheri likes it much when I travel; for some reason, she wants me to keep the excitement level to a minimum. Here's a view of Baghdad from the helicopter on my last trip:</p>

<p>Thanks for your prayers, and I'll have another post in a couple of days.Â </p>
