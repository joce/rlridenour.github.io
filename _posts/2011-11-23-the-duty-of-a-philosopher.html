<blockquote>
<p>Out of love for mankind, and out of despair at my embarrassing situation, seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was unable to make anything easier than it had already been made, and moved by a genuine interest in those who are dedicated to making everything easy, I conceived it as my task [the task of the philosopher] to create difficulties everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, <em>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</em></p>
