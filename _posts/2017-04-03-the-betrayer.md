With a kiss,  
Judas gave his Lord  
one last chance to be  
the Messiah of Judas' dreams.

Am I no better than Judas,  
when I twist the words of the Lord  
and manipulate them for my own purposes?

Willing to betray the Lord,   
and for what?

Not even thirty pieces of silver.

Forgive my blindness,  
unable to see the difference  
between the kingdoms of this world  
and the Kingdom of God.

*Amen*
