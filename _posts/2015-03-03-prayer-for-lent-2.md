I see a man  
sleeping on a bench  
in the cold,

And I say,

"Thank you, Lord,  
for I am not like him."

I see a woman  
alone, in tears,  
mourning,

And I say,

"Thank you, Lord,  
for I am not like her."

I see a man  
upon a cross,  
humiliated, scorned,  
despised,

And suddenly my  
foolish pride is clear  
even to me,

And I cry,

"Forgive me, Lord,  
for I am not like you."

*Amen*
