Holy God,

Shall this year be like the past,  
giving up that which brings joy,  
so that my self-imposed poverty may be   
a sign of spiritual superiority?

Instead, Lord,  
by your grace,  
may I give up   
bitterness, arrogance,  
animosity, and the  
unwarranted certainty  
that keeps me from  
loving my neighbor.

Cover me with your ashes,  
and raise me again   
to walk anew  
in your kingdom.

*Amen*
