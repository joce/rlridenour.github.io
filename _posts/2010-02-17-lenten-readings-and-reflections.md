<p>My church, <a href="http://www.northhavenchurch.net/index.php">NorthHaven Church</a> in Norman, OK, has produced a booklet of devotional reflections for Lent. There is a short devotional for each day written by a member of the church, based on readings from Year C of the <em>Revised Common Lectionary</em>. The pastor, Mitch Randall, is posting the devotional for the day on his blog. I will try to post a link each day.</p>
