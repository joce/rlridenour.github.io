<p>It’s interesting that the prominent atheist <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3255972/Harry-Potter-fails-to-cast-spell-over-Professor-Richard-Dawkins.html">Richard Dawkins</a> is now claiming that reading J.K. Rowling’s <em>Harry Potter</em> books is dangerous for children. </p>
<p>I never thought I would see Richard Dawkins taking the same position as conservative Christians. </p>
