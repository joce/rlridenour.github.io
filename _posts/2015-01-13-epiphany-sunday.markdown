Brian Partridge's sermon this past Sunday was a perfect antidote to our annual festival of accumulation thinly disguised as a celebration of the birth of Christ. So, I guess I should stop browsing ebay.  Here is the prayer for the week:

Holy God,

Let me not be deceived;  
these things that I possess,  
do I use them,  
or do they use me?

Help me to loosen my grip  
on that which I so tightly grasp,  
so that I can open my hands to you.

*Amen*
