We say that God helps those who help themselves,  
that cleanliness is next to godliness,  
that money is the root of all evil,  
that God will not give us more than we can handle,  
and that he works in mysterious ways.

Father,

Open our eyes to the Scripture you have given us,  
and free us from the temptation  
to turn it into the one that we want.

*Amen*
