<div class="link_description">
<p>In today's <em>Washington Post</em>, Petula Dvorak's column includes a story about a 6-year-old who was told by her mother to scale back her Christmas list. So, she wrote a letter to "Dear Sata" asking for just one thing, a remote control that controlled the world.</p>
<p>When her mother pointed out that the salutation was missing an "N", she simply added it to the end of the name. So, it read, "Dear Satan,&hellip;" Fitting, somehow.</p>
