*A poem for Memorial Day, 2015, written after conducting a funeral at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery, April 23, 2015.*

The boy stared, amazed  
at the ranks and files  
of perfect straight lines.  

Each member stood  
at attention, a silent and still  
granite memorial to one  
who was a child once

before youth was taken,  
leaving only scars

if anything at all.
