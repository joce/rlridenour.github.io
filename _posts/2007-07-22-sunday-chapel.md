<p>I went to chapel this morning. For some reason, there is an expectation that the chaplains will attend chapel! It was a good service, although it was a bit strange to see the ushers all wearing 9 mm handguns. Maybe churches at home would have more success in meeting their annual budgets if the ushers would start packing heat.</p>
<p>Blessings...</p>
