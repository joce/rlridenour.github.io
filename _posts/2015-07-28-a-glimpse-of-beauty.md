God of Grace,

Everywhere we turn  
we are flooded with  
sights and sounds  
of evil,  
tragedy,  
injustice,  
and the suffering  
of the innocent.

And even we,  
watching from places  
of comfort and security  
can be overwhelmed  
by the darkness,  
and begin to lose hope.

Then, we see a baby smile,  
and the light breaks in,  
reminding us that hope prevails  
and that beauty surrounds us,  
a gracious reminder of  
the world that was,  
is,  
and is to come.

*Amen*
