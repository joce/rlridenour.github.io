*"...but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty."*

Lord of life,  

I do not fully understand  
what it is that you offer,  
but I know that I  
desperately need it,  
for my soul is  
dry and parched.

Who am I,  
that you should  
extend your cup to me?

Who am I,  
to have ever thought  
of refusing it?

Who am I,  
having tasted the  
life-giving water,  
to not share it  
with others who also  
thirst for you?

So, let the waters flow  
to us,  
in us,  
around us,  
and through us.

*Amen*
