Gracious God,

Despite my presumptuous plans,  
there is no guarantee of the future,  
not even of the next moment on this earth;  
for that moment is hidden from me until it comes,  
and only you know what this day will bring.

Help me to see this day for what it is,  
a gift, although expected,  
one that was surely not owed,  
an act of immeasurable grace.

So, thank you for this day  
of incomparable worth.

It is all I have,  
but it is surely enough.

*Amen*
