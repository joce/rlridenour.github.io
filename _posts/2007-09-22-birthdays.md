<p>We gather every month for a birthday party. All those who have birthdays for September will be honored. We have a cake to eat, and we'll probably play some volleyball. Part of the challenge for everyone is keeping in good spirits when those important events of life occur. It's hard having a birthday, anniversary, or other significant event happen while you're away from home. You can celebrate with your adopted family here, but it's not the same as being home. I've been thinking of things to do for Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you have any ideas, I'd be grateful to hear them.</p>
