<p>Here are two pictures from the clinic that we go to on Saturdays. The first is a child who has a new toy. The second is of a group of teenagers who work there. They were just finishing up building a new wheelchair out of a plastic outdoor chair.</p>
<p>We could use some more toys, and we could really use some shoes, men's, women's and children's, to give away.</p>

<p>Pray for those who are struggling who just want a better life in a peaceful country. </p>
