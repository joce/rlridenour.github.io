<p>IÂ  would like to write a blog listing the significant events of the year or the major lessons I learned this year, but there is no time. I have to pack tonight to leave on a trip tomorrow to visit some soldiers that are somewhere near the Iranian border. Someone said once that an optimist stays up until midnight to see the new year in, while a pessimist stays up to make sure the old one left. Somehow, I feel a part of both camps. All in all, 2007 was a year of many blessings, but I'm glad to see it gone. Welcome, 2008!</p>
