Love left its throne,  
to join us in our   
weakness and frailty,  
divine majesty  
in a helpless babe,

To walk,  
and laugh,  
and cry  
with us,

To show us what love  
was willing to risk  
for our sake.

And no matter  
how much we tried,  
even we could not  
destroy its power.

Today, may love again  
walk with my feet and  
speak through my mouth.

*Amen*
