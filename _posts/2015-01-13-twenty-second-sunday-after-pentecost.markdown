Merciful God,

This day marks the end of the war  
that was to be the last.  
That we thought it so was just  
another sign of our arrogance. 

We use this day now  
to give thanks for  
those who have served.

And as we remember them,  
let us not do so  
through the eyes of the world,  
which values only  
security,  
power,  
and wealth.

Let us look instead  
through the eyes of  
the Crucified One,  
who looks upon us  
with  
humility,  
sacrifice,  
and love.

For it is only then  
that we understand  
the cost borne  
by those who have  
"No greater love  
than this."

*Amen*
