<p>Today is our anniversary. I have been married to Sheri for 23 years, and am looking forward to at least 50 more. I thank God every day for her, and the wedding pronouncement is correct: what God has brought together, no one, not even the Army, can bring apart.</p>
<p>I love you, still and always...</p>
