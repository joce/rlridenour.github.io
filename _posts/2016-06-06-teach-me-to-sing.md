Voice of Heaven,

- Words become thoughts,
- {:.indent-3}thoughts, beliefs,
- {:.indent-4}and beliefs, actions;
- and that which I
- once merely heard
- is soon that which I am.
{:.poetry}

- So, help me ignore 
- the voices that inspire
- hatred and misery,
- {:.indent-3}distress and malice,
- {:.indent-4}selfishness and fear,
{:.poetry}

- May I again hear the
- words of love and joy,
- {:.indent-3}peace and kindness,
- {:.indent-4}generosity and hope;
{:.poetry}

- And by hearing,
- {:.indent-3}learn to speak,
- and by speaking,
- {:.indent-3}learn to sing with the
- Father, Son, and Spirit.
{:.poetry}

- Three distinct voices,
- {:.indent-3}in one beautiful song.
{:.poetry}
*Amen*
