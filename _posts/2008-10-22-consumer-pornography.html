<p>Prophetic thought for the day from Mark Woods, editor of Britain's <em>Baptist Times</em>, in a column for <a href="http://www.ethicsdaily.com/article_detail.cfm?AID=11221">Ethics Daily.com</a>:</p>
<p>"The glossy lifestyle magazines which are such a feature of weekend papers are consumer pornography, designed to titillate us with longings for what most of us can never have, and those of us who can will never need."</p>
