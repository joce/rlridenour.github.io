<p>I began a three day combat lifesaver's course today. The highlight of the day was having a six inch rubber hose shoved up my nose. It's something called a nasal pharyngeal airway, and is designed to keep a patient's airway open. The sadists teaching the course maintain that you can't really give one to someone else unless you know how it feels to have it done to you. It goes up the nose, all the way in, until you feel it on the back of your tongue. It felt pretty much just as I expected it to. Tomorrow, we do IV's.</p>
