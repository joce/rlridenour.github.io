These are [terrible pictures](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/01/earthquake_in_haiti.html) from Boston.com of the devastation in Haiti.

The Haitian consul-general to the UN reports that at least 100,000 are dead, possibly several times that number. See this <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/13/haiti.earthquake/index.html">CNN</a> link.
