Lord, hear my prayer.

For saying that something needs to be done  
while refusing to do anything myself, 

*Lord, have mercy.*

For believing that cries of outrage  
were the same as acts of love,

*Lord, have mercy.*

For letting my own ego keep me from   
reaching out to those with whom I disagree.

*Lord, have mercy.*

For pretending that loving humanity   
was the same as loving my neighbor,

*Lord, have mercy.*

*Amen*
