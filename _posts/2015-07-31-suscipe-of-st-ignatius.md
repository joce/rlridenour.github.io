Today is the feast day of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Here is one of his prayers:

*Suscipe (Receive)*

Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty,   
my memory, my understanding  
and my entire will,  
All I have and call my own.
 
You have given all to me.  
To you, Lord, I return it.
 
Everything is yours; do with it what you will.  
Give me only your love and your grace.  
That is enough for me.

*Amen*
