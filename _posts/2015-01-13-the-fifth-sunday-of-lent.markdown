Lord Jesus,  
  
What kind of king are you?  

The kingdoms of this earth  
Pride themselves on their power,  
Their majesty,  
Their influence,  
And their wealth.  

Yet you say that your kingdom is like  
A small seed,  
Yeast,  
And a net.  

May your kingdom fill our lives  
As the yeast permeates the dough.  
As we grow from this small seed  
May we provide shelter and shade to those in need,  
Yet remaining rooted in you,  
And drawing nourishment from your compassion.  

And when the day comes,  
We pray that you will  
Catch us in your net of love,  
Drawing us to our eternal home  
In your arms.  
  
Amen
