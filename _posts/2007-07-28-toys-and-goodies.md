<p>I went to a clinic today with a box of toys to pass out to the kids. It was a lot of fun, and I and and the Chaplain's Assistant are looking forward to the next trip. They have a nursing training program, a vision health training program, and someone training to do basic dental work. If you know any dentists who would like to donate some dental cleaning equipment, then let me know.</p>
<p>Blessings...</p>
