<p>It's been a relatively easy couple of days here. That has given me some time to work on a small project for the corps chaplain's office. There are two chaplain's assistants who are headed to a meeting to discuss ethics issues in the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters, and I have been asked to provide some background material for them. I think that most of the discussion about ethical lapses in the current war miss an important point. We tend toÂ overstimate the degree to which our internal character states influence our behavior, and understimate the degree to which the situation influences our behavior. There are several interesting experiments that show that, in particular situations, ordinary people can easily do things apparently incompatible with their values. Unfortunately, the relevant features of these situations are all found in combat.</p>
<p>In future posts, I'll try to talk about the experiments and what they show.</p>
