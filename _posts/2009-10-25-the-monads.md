<div class="link_description">
<p>From the "<a href="http://tar.weatherson.org/">Thoughts, Arguments, and Rants</a>" blog, here is a link to a band called "The Monads" and it's reincarnation, "The 21st Century Monads." No educated person could resist songs with titles like "The Skeptic Song" and "The Missing Shade of Blues." There's even a song expressing the emotional depths of the academic life: "My Paper Was Rejected Again."</p>
