Lord Jesus,  

As I find myself  
grasping for more,  
even though I  
surely have enough,

I hear the voice  
of the Spirit whisper,  
"Is this how you  
follow the one  
who had no place  
to lay his head,  
whose only robe  
was taken from him  
and gambled away?"

May I never confuse  
the abundant life  
with an empty  
life of abundance.

*Amen*
