Sheri and I recently spent the weekend with some soldiers from my Afghanistan deployment and their families. I wrote this prayer after reflecting on the experience:


God of promise and hope,  

We give thanks today for shared memories.  

The stories bring healing  
as they are told and retold,  
for they remind us  
that joy is found in surprising places.  

Cherish our remembering,  
and strengthen our minds  
as the years pass,  
for you are God, our God,  
who forgets no one.  

Amen
