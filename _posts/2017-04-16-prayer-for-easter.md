![Weeping Mary](/images/2017/weeping-mary.jpg)

"Who is it you are looking for?"  
is a question for me,  
not just for Mary.

Mary looked at Jesus, and saw the gardener.

I look at my  
neighbor, and see a stranger;  
a stranger, an see an antagonist;  
an antagonist, and see an enemy.

Help me, Lord, to see you,  
wherever, and whoever, you are.

*Amen*
